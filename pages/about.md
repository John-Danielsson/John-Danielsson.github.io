# Portfolio Jekyll Theme

This is a personal portfolio theme that I built from the ground up, using the [DevTips Starter Kit](http://devtipsstarterkit.com/) as a foundation for starting, and following closely the amazing tutorial by [Travis Neilson over at DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6jKLsxbFg4&list=PL0CB3OvPhDA_STygmp3sDenx3UpdOMk7P). You can [check out the demo](lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/), and [fork the repository](https://github.com/LeNPaul/portfolio-jekyll-theme/fork), to get started.

## About

Cybersecurity-focused software engineer transitioning into dedicated security roles, with a passion for building resilient systems and protecting sensitive data. CompTIA Security+ and Network+ certified, I bring hands-on expertise in SIEM (Splunk), log analysis, incident response, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, network security, Zero Trust, NIST frameworks, and cloud security (Azure). As a Deaf professional thriving in text-first, asynchronous, and distributed environments, I excel at clear communication and remote collaboration, while my proficiency in Spanish adds a multicultural edge to team dynamics.

In my self-employed IT consulting role, I've automated workflows using Python and cloud tools, slashing operational loads by 90% and advising clients on secure AI integration and cybersecurity best practices. At Optispan, I developed secure web apps and data pipelines in HIPAA-regulated healthcare settings, boosting performance by 20x while ensuring compliance and endpoint protection. Earlier, as a CIDF intern at the University of Washington, I managed documentation for high-performance computing clusters, troubleshooting networks and enhancing user support—skills that honed my systems administration and network engineering abilities.

Currently pursuing a BS in Informatics at UW (expected Spring 2027), I'm eager for roles as a SOC Analyst, Cybersecurity Analyst, Systems Administrator, or Network Engineer. A former NCAA Division I PAC-12 Champion in men's rowing, I embody discipline, teamwork, and resilience. Let's connect if you're building innovative security teams—I'm ready to contribute and grow!
